## Modifications

### Planned
* Add ACE Modules
* Add HALO Jump System from Comfy Downtime
* Add Arsenal Blacklist that has certain weapons in it (Minigun + Weapon Bags).
* Replace Weather Script with ACE Weather
* Add proper default parameters
* Replace Atlas LHD with CUP LHD
* Add Advanced Slingloading Script to Mission
* Add Action at the base to clean up corpses around the base. Maybe a second one for Admins to remove all corpses from the mission
* Put Preprocessor defines for GUI's in one file, so makepbo doesen't abort when it detects multiple declarations of the same define.
* Apply setUnitTrait to all players.
* Disable Intro and Cinematics by default
* Add better intro image and logo so people don't think this is a ""meme"" mission and joke around because of this.
* Add more static Objects in the build menu (A2 Fortifications and Sandbags, etc...).

### Done
* Remove FAR_Revive
* Remove HALO Jump System
* CUP Compatibility
