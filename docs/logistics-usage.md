# Logistics in Liberation
There are many options for logistics in Liberation that are at your disposal.

* **Carry/Dragging Objects**: Building Objects have ACE_Drag added, so they can be carried and dragged around by infantry (ACE Interace and then carry, just like you would on an ammobox).
* **Loading/Unloading Objects**: Building Objects have ACE_Cargo Added, so they can be loaded into vehicles (Always take up 1 space)
* **Vehicle Rearming**: Rearming of Vehicles can be done by spawning an Ammo Resupply vehicle, or a Vehicle ammo crate and then use ACE_Rearm to refull your vehicle or static weapon ammo.
* **Vehicle Refuel**: with ACE_Refuel you can use a Refuel truck (From build menu) and use the hose to refuel a vehicle of your choice.
* **Vehicle Repair**: Vehicles can be partially repaired with a toolkit, or alternatively can be fully repaired with a Repair truck nearby.
* **Slingloading**: The advanced slingloading has been installed, which can be used by ACE_SelfInterace near a chopper to deploy ropes and then you can pick them up (Again self-interact. All Slingload Sctions are self-interact) and tie them to a vehicle of your choice (Any Vehicle).
