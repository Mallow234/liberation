# Logistics in Liberation
There are many options for logistics in Liberation that are at your disposal.

## General Logistics
* **Carry/Dragging Objects**: Building Objects have ACE_Drag added, so they can be carried and dragged around by infantry (ACE Interace and then carry, just like you would on an ammobox).
* **Loading/Unloading Objects**: Building Objects have ACE_Cargo Added, so they can be loaded into vehicles (Always take up 1 space)
* **Vehicle Rearming**: Rearming of Vehicles can be done by spawning an Ammo Resupply vehicle, or a Vehicle ammo crate and then use ACE_Rearm to refull your vehicle or static weapon ammo.
* **Vehicle Refuel**: with ACE_Refuel you can use a Refuel truck (From build menu) and use the hose to refuel a vehicle of your choice.
* **Vehicle Repair**: Vehicles can be partially repaired with a toolkit, or alternatively can be fully repaired with a Repair truck nearby.
* **Slingloading**: The advanced slingloading has been installed, which can be used by ACE_SelfInterace near a chopper to deploy ropes and then you can pick them up (Again self-interact. All Slingload Sctions are self-interact) and tie them to a vehicle of your choice (Any Vehicle).

## Transporting Infantry Gear
If you want to bring infantry gear to the front, you can also make use of Ammoboxes. These can be found in the build menu under the Support tab, and can be filled with any kind of gear from the arsenal and other loot found. These boxes can then be loaded into vehicles and transported anywhere.

This way, you can transport more gear than just by filling the vehicle with ammo.

Keep in mind that ammobox contents will not be saved and the ammobox will be empty if you store it in the base and load a savegame. This may be changed in the future but right now this isn't the case.

## Spawning Spare Tracks and Tires
In the Build menu, under the support tab, theres entries for spawning both Spare Tires and Tracks. Use these to replace damaged or destroyed Vehicle Tires and Tracks.
