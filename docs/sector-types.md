# Sector Types
This documents the differences between the 5 different sector types.

## Points of Interest / Capture Points
generally small to medium towns, each point of interest you control will raise your troop recruitment capacity.

## Military Bases
Full of OPFOR Military personnel, the bases will also yield large quantities of ammunition that will be useful to upgrade your firepower. However these installations are heavily defended and will require large and well coordinated assaults. some military bases will unlock a vehicle upon capture. (see marker above the base to see what the base will unlock ).

## Factories
Factories will give you the fuel you need to deploy more vehicles.

## Radio Towers
when under OPFOR control, radio towers will be used to call in reinforcements when a nearby sector is attacked. The reaction time will depend on the distance between the tower and the sector. When under BLUFOR control, the towers will give useful information on hostile troop movements in the vicinity by using their radio communications (marked with red exclamation marks on map).

## Big Cities
Victory will be accomplished when all of the Big City territories are under BLUFOR Control.
