						&lt;br/&gt;
						Ladies, welcome to Liberation!&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						The enemy forces have surprised us with a brutal and overwhelming offensive. They now control the entire island but thanks to your efforts, it won't last long.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						Our objective is simple: liberate the region.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						The road to victory will be long and dangerous. You will have to conquer multiple sectors and acquire the necessary resources to improve the quantity and quality of friendly forces engaged in this campaign.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						Moreover, enemy forces will most certainly react to our advance. You will have to complete Secondary Objectives to weaken a foe that fights with higher numbers and better equipment than you do.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						In your efforts you will need the support of the local population, so always make sure to double-check what you're shooting at.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						Questions?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

						&lt;t size='10'&gt;&lt;img image='res\tuto\fob.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/t&gt;
						&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						You begin the campaign in a safe zone that the enemy won't dare to attack. Your first choice is to choose where you want to deploy. At the beginning you can only deploy at Chimera but as you progress, more options will become available such as forward operation bases (FOBs) and mobile respawns.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						At your starting location you can choose your equipment from the Virtual Arsenal. You will also find your first FOB packaged inside a container, a slingloading-capable helicopter and a few other transport choices.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						You will have to ferry that container with the helicopter (unless you have chosen to start with the first FOB already built) and you can deploy this first FOB wherever you want, so it's up to you to choose the right place to start your campaign.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

						<Original>3. Objective</Original>
				</Key>
				<Key ID="STR_TUTO_TEXT3">
						<Original>&lt;br/&gt;
						The main objective of the campaign is to kick the enemy out. To achieve this, you will have to liberate all the Major Cities on the map. This is the only victory condition for the campaign.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						But those cities are tough nuts to crack with only limited resources and a well established enemy force. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						To succeed, you will have to capture large numbers of different sectors, each with their own use.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						</Original>
				</Key>
				<Key ID="STR_TUTO_TITLE4">
						<Original>4. Sectors</Original>
				</Key>
				<Key ID="STR_TUTO_TEXT4">
						<Original>&lt;br/&gt;
						Sectors are split into 5 different types:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						- Points of Interest: Generally small to medium towns, each point of interest you control will raise your troop recruitment capacity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						- Military Bases: Full of enemy personnel, the bases will also yield large quantities of Ammunition that will be useful to upgrade your firepower. However these installations are heavily defended and will require large and well coordinated assaults.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						- Factories: Factories will give you the fuel you need to deploy more vehicles.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						- Radio Towers: When under enemy control, radio towers will be used to call in reinforcements when a nearby sector is attacked. The reaction time will depend on the distance between the tower and the sector. When under friendly control, the towers will give useful information on hostile troop movements in the vicinity by using their radio communications.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						- Major Cities: When all of the cities are under friendly control, you win!&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

						&lt;t size='10'&gt;&lt;img image='res\tuto\ress.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/t&gt;
						&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						In this campaign you have to manage three types of resources:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						- &lt;t color='#00ff00'&gt;MANPOWER:&lt;/t&gt; Manpower is linked to the number of points of interest you control. A larger amount of Manpower allows you to raise the quality and quantity of your ground troops. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						- &lt;t color='#ff0000'&gt;AMMO:&lt;/t&gt; Ammunition is used to deploy armed vehicles, tanks and elite soldiers. It can be stocked forever and used only when necessary. Ammunition is contained in boxes that can be retrieved from military bases, or Secondary Objectives. Those crates have to be moved back to an FOB by truck or slingload, then recycled to increase your ammunition stockpile.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						- &lt;t color='#ffff00'&gt;FUEL:&lt;/t&gt; Fuel is used by every vehicle, some being more thirsty than others. The fuel levels depends on how many factories are controlled by friendly forces.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						</Original>

				<Key ID="STR_TUTO_TITLE6">
						<Original>6. Alert Level</Original>
				</Key>
				<Key ID="STR_TUTO_TEXT6">
						<Original>&lt;br/&gt;
						The enemy won't let you liberate all of their brand new territories without reacting badly. When you begin the campaign, hostile forces will only be composed of the garrisons inside military bases. However as you become more threatening by liberating more and more sectors, the enemy will start calling in more reinforcements, armour and equipment to counter you.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						To limit the enemies operational capabilities, you will have to tread carefully and complete Secondary Objectives where available. This is not required to win the campaign but if you ignore the Alert Level for too long, you're in for quite a lot of trouble.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

				<Key ID="STR_TUTO_TITLE7">
						<Original>7. Construction</Original>
				</Key>
				<Key ID="STR_TUTO_TEXT7">
						<Original>&lt;br/&gt;
						To help you succeed in your endeavours, you have the "BUILD" capability that allows you to deploy units, vehicles, defences, fortifications and so on. Depending on your resources of course.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						The construction system will be available when you are within 100 meters of a FOB headquarters. A contextual "BUILD" option will appear then in your scroll menus.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

						<Original>8. Deploying another FOB</Original>
				</Key>
				<Key ID="STR_TUTO_TEXT8">
						<Original>&lt;br/&gt;
						To build a brand new FOB go to the construction menu, under the logistics tab, build an FOB container or FOB truck.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						Then you can move the FOB container/drive the FOB truck where you want to deploy your shiny new FOB. However be aware that you can't build an FOB within an existing sector, or within 2km of any other FOB.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

				<Key ID="STR_TUTO_TITLE9">
						<Original>9. Secondary Objectives</Original>
				</Key>
				<Key ID="STR_TUTO_TEXT9">
						<Original>&lt;br/&gt;
						When you capture sectors, sometimes the few hostiles forces left will surrender. You can then capture these prisoners and take them to a nearby FOB to be interrogated automatically.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						That interrogatory, executed in the utmost respect of the Geneva conventions, will allow you to obtain more Intel points which you can then spend on a Secondary Objective.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						Completing these Secondary Objectives will reward you with different advantages such as more Ammunition, more Intel or even decreasing the enemy Alert Level.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

				<Key ID="STR_TUTO_TEXT10">
						<Original>&lt;br/&gt;
						When a player uses the Commander slot (the last slot of the list), they get access to a Zeus interface by pressing the corresponding key (U by default). This interface allows you to command NATO forces in 3D view or map view.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						Moreover the Commander gets additional build options that will allow them to obtain crewed vehicles or entire pre-made squads, as well as an infinite support system, this is simply for cinematic uses and can be utilised as a bonus feature.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
						This role is not mandatory but strongly recommended for smaller groups of players.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

						&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						&lt;t size='1'&gt;
						Hostile forces use an array of small logistic bases situated behind the front lines. Destroying those assets would greatly disrupt the enemy supply lines and impair their capacity to react to our actions.&lt;/t&gt;
						&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						&lt;t size='1'&gt;
						Your mission is to destroy all supply assets (trucks and containers) at the objective by any means at your disposal. Unfortunately our intelligence is not able to provide you with a precise position for the base, you will have to locate the objective in the red zone on your map.&lt;/t&gt;

						Enemy forces use road convoys to resupply their defensive positions. Intercepting one of these convoys would effectively disrupt their supply lines and we could use the occasion to retrieve a hefty amount of ammunition.&lt;/t&gt;
